1. Given an n-ary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level).

   For example, given a `3-ary` tree:

    

   ![img](./narytreeexample.png)

    

   We should return its level order traversal:

   ```
   [
        [1],
        [3,2,4],
        [5,6]
   ]

   ```

    

   **Note:**

   1. The depth of the tree is at most `1000`.
   2. The total number of nodes is at most `5000`.
